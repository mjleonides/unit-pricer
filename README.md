## About

Calculating the best unit price while shopping online can be surprisingly time-consuming.

I was frustrated with the hassle of manually calculating prices per ounce or item, so I created this tool.

### Features

- üíæ Inserted prices survive browser refresh and closed window/tab
- üì± Offline mode (Progressive Web App)
