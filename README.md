# Unit Pricer

Calculating the best unit price while shopping online can be surprisingly time-consuming.

I was frustrated with the hassle of manually calculating prices per ounce or item, so I created this tool.

Itâ€™s designed to quickly calculate the best unit price when comparing multiple products, saving you a few seconds and helping you make a smarter purchase.

## Features

- Calculate unit price from cost and quantity
- Label and compare multiple prices at a glance
- Inserted prices survive browser refresh and closed window/tab
- Offline mode (Progressive Web App)
